# General Info
This is where you can upload and source control your code as you program your display.
Each diplay has its own folder, and store code in its respective display folder.

# Notes on Prototype Folder
This is where you can share small pieces of code that can help other memebers in the project they are leading.
I pushed some prototype code from last year. It includes:
* 7 segment display
* LED strips
* Button & button debounce
* Joy stick (warning: was not tested enough)

If your display includes buttons, I recommend to use **button debounce** code that I wrote so that you can save a bit of time on that.
Feel free to use these programs (I think small modifications would be required to use it in your code tho), comment, modify the code, and upload new ones as you develop your display. If any of the Arduino code uploaded now does not work on yours, please let Ann know and she can help you with that.
